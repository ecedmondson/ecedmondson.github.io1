      <h3>Python Brain Teasers #1</h3>
      <p class="byline">My engineering team at work has a sprint retro each sprint where one of the agenda items is any valuable learnings. Because it was up to team members to both retain and prepare a small learning from the past sprint, it frequently went skipped. I decided to start doing brainteasers with my team related to topics that might be relevant to our work or stack.</p>

    <div class="longform-body">
      <p>I wrote this brainteaser based on a feature of Python that has burned me more times than I am comfortable admitting.</a> Here's the code. The prompt is to predict the output:</p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-python inner-piece">
        def print_conditionally(val):
                print(val)
                if not isinstance(val, int):
                    print("you cheated! i only want integers.")
                if val < 7:
                    print("this seems like a healthy number of donuts")
                if val >= 7:
                    print("this is probably too many donuts")

        my_funcs = []

        for i in range(-2, 15, 3):
            my_funcs.append(lambda: print_conditionally(i))

        for func in my_funcs:
            func()
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>So what will the output of this code be?</p>
