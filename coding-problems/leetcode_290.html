      <h3>Leetcode #217</h3>
      <p class="byline">In my (unfinished) post-baccalaureate CS program I took a class on algorithms. At the time I was working a full time job, was a part time student, and caring for a family member with a broken collarbone. All of this was, perhaps, not a suitable environment for retaining the information I have learned. Join me on my journeys through leetcode, hacker rank, Cracking the Coding Interview, and Grokking Modern System Design as I try to retain some of this information in a more relaxed environment.</p>

    <div class="longform-body">
      <p>This problem comes from Leetcode and was the problem of the day on 1/1/2023, a day that I strangely felt new-years-resolutiony. Luckily Leetcode was gentle to me and gave me an <i>easy</i> tiered array/string and hashing problem:</p>
      <div class="coding-prompt inner-piece">
        <p>Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.</p>
      </div>
      <p>I think there are two  main "tricks" here: 1) looking up bijection in the dictionary and 2)  that we have to double hash. Consider, for example, the input provided by leetcode <i>pattern="abba"</i> and <i>s="dog cat cat dog"</i>. This is a proper follow and you can actually get away with single hashing. But that's the trick! If you take a slightly more complicated input <i>pattern="abba"</i> and <i>s="dog dog dog dog"</i> and only hash unidirectionally, then your answer is wrong. For example, this (incorrect) solution:</p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-python inner-piece">
          class Solution:
              def wordPattern(self, pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
                  splits = s.split(" ")
                  if len(pattern) != len(splits):
                      return False
                  # can assume same lengths
                  lengths = len(pattern)
                  patternmap = {}
                  for i in range(lengths):
                      p, w = pattern[i], splits[i]
                      if p in patternmap and patternmap[p] != w:
                          return False
                      patternmap[p] = w
                  return True
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>So, yeah, I fell for the trick and my input failed. I realized immediately what had happened and amended the problem:</p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-python inner-piece">
          class Solution:
              def wordPattern(self, pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
                  splits = s.split(" ")
                  if len(pattern) != len(splits):
                      return False
                  # can assume same lengths
                  lengths = len(pattern)
                  patternmap = {}
                  wmap = {}
                  for i in range(lengths):
                      p, w = pattern[i], splits[i]
                      if p in patternmap and patternmap[p] != w:
                          return False
                      if w in wmap and wmap[w] != p:
                          return False
                      wmap[w] = p
                      patternmap[p] = w
                  return True
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>This is O(n) time complexity with 2O(n) space-complexity...or as I like to call it...O(n).</p>
      <p>I know this was an "easy" problem, but it was encouraging to be able to find a solution to it all by myself and relatively easily, mostly because I just jumped into it on Leetcode instead of using a guided program like Neetcode, Grokking or Daily Coding Problem. I did later look at my solution compared to other, smarter people's and it looks like I am pretty spot on. That's encouraging because it's solid proof that you can learn these patterns.</p>
